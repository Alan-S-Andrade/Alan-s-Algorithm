  Based on the starting position of our bot. We either go to the top right gadget
or the bottom left gadget.  Having acquired this power-up, we use this power-up
as soon as possible - meaning on the next cycle that we had paint.  Our movement
is relative angle is 113 or 270.  We have an angle of 270 when we want the
first powerup on the first bonk interrupt. We have 113 relative angle thereafter
as we move throughout the tiles with our paint buckets.
  We pick up while we are still moving through the platform - this is an optimization
in tasks since we pickup powerups while still solving puzzles. We also never stop
even while solving puzzles and if we have empty buckets in order to increase
chances of obtaining powerups.  Since we have a strategy where we use the powerup
immediately after picking it up, we rarely end up having two powerups in our inventory
at the same time.
